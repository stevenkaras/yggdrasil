Design Philosophy
=================
The goal of this project is rather humble. We only want to provide platform agnostic macros and support for very basic system services. Only platform-dependent code will be accepted here.

Initially, yggdrasil will target the following platforms: windows, linux, android.
Eventually, I would like to add support for the following platforms, but it will require a significant budget (or code donations): mac os, ios, ps3, xbox, wii


License choice
--------------
I have chosen the particularly open license that I did since I'd like to use this project in my own commercial and open source projects, and I can't be bothered to deal with all that legal crap. Most developers can't be.
